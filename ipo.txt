----------------INPUT----------------

The user will guess a random number out of 100.
The way the website will recieve this number is through a number input and a submit button.
The user may restart the game using a dedicated reset button.


----------------PROCESSING----------------

On start of the game, create a random number from 1 - 1000.
Also create a guess counter and a high score.

Check user input when submit button is pressed.
    Add 1 to the guess count.
    Compare the input to the user input.
        If the user input is right, compare the current amount of guesses to the high score.
            If the user got a new high score, save the guess amount to the high score.
            Reset the number of guesses.
            Reset the random number to a new number between 1 - 1000.


----------------OUTPUT----------------

When the user input is compared to the random number, tell them if they are right or not.
If they are wrong, tell them if they need to guess higher or lower.
Otherwise (if they're right) tell them they're right.
    Tell them the amount of guesses it took to get to that correct guess.
    Tell them if they beat the high score or not.
